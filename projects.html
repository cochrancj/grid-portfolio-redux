		    	<p>This is a re-creation of the popular kids' game Concentration using a combination of HTML, CSS and jQuery. </p>
		  		<p>I wanted to make this version more adult-friendly by making the matches harder (all of the images are of the same general thing - owls - and feature the same color palette and basic shapes). I also included a mechanism by which to gauge improvement by adding a simple click counter. You also get a surprise lightswitch rave if you match all tiles - and the main game board state features an Easter egg to explain the pop culture reference.</p>
		  		<p>This was the first project I completed during the Web Development Immersive course I took at General Assembly. </p>

		    	<p>This is a RESTful CRUD application built as a point-of-sale interface for restaurant servers. This app was created in Ruby using a SQL database (psql). </p>
		    	<p>Admin Login<br>
		    	<i>Username: taco <br>
		    	Password: bell</i> </p>
		  		<p>R E S T was created with the mobile user in mind (I had envisioned servers with iPads when coming up with the minimalist design and oversized buttons). Users (servers) can create tables, take orders, amend orders and delete them by marking the bill as paid. Managers have admin access and can add new servers, as well as edit and create new menu items.</p>
