			<div class="project-right">
		    	<p>This is a re-creation of the popular kids' game Concentration using a combination of HTML, CSS and jQuery. </p>
		  		<p>I wanted to make this version more adult-friendly by making the matches harder (all of the images are of the same general thing - owls - and feature the same color palette and basic shapes). I also included a mechanism by which to gauge improvement by adding a simple click counter. You also get a surprise lightswitch rave if you match all tiles - and the main game board state features an Easter egg to explain the pop culture reference.</p>

		  		<p>R E S T was created with the mobile user in mind (I had envisioned servers with iPads when coming up with the minimalist design and oversized buttons). Users (servers) can create tables, take orders, amend orders and delete them by marking the bill as paid. Managers have admin access and can add new servers, as well as edit and create new menu items.</p>

I served as lead front end developer of the group and was in charge of the creative direction of the site and coding the front end of all but the profile page. This app was created using a combination of Node.js, Express, MongoDb, Mongoose and the Semantic UI framework. </p>

		  		<p>HipSpace was created to answer the age old question: where should I live? Users take a quiz, answering questions on their preferences, and are given their HipScore and corresponding neighborhood they should live in. Users can then explore their new neighborhood and find what matters most to them.</p>
		  		<p>Users can then create an account to store their result and re-visit that neighborhood whenever they want to. Users can also update their quiz answers if thier priorities shift. </p>

The Dead Rabbit Society is a veteran-run charity organization formed as a way for former service members and likeminded people to give back to their communities and make a tangible difference. This task manager is a way volunteers can see what remains to be done with each charity project, and what priority each task carries. This app was created in the MEAN stack using Mongo dB, Express.js, Angular and Node.js. </p>

		    	<p>Game of Fitness is a card-based workout of the day applicaiton based on a simple fitness card game - each suit (in this case Enchantment, Land, Sorcery and Tribal instead of Spade, Club, Heart and Diamond) is assigned an exercise and each card value corresponds to the number of reps required. The workout is completed when all 52 cards have been dealt. This app was created in Ruby using a SQL database (psql) and consumes an API I created using AngularJS. </p>

		  		<p>Game of Fitness was created with a particular group in mind (an online network I am a part of). Users can create accounts, deal random workouts, mark individual exercises as complete, and earn mana points for each exercise they do. </p>
		  		<p>In version 2, I hope to include some sort of boss battle mechanism utilizing loot that the player also earns by completing workouts. </p>
